# Credit-Scoring-Model-for-Consumer-Loans-in-Banking
This project involves building a Credit Scoring Model for consumer lending in the banking sector. The model predicts customer creditworthiness, assigns a risk score, and estimates loan default probability. It also helps optimize loan amounts and durations, providing a robust solution for managing credit risk in consumer loans.
 
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Perform the following steps for Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset:

 **Explore the Dataset Structure**:
   - Use the `.info()` method to examine the dataset's structure, including data types and non-null counts.
   - Apply the `.describe()` method to generate summary statistics for numerical features.

 **Analyze Feature Distributions**:
   - Create visualizations such as histograms and count plots for both numerical and categorical features to assess their distributions.

 **Conduct Correlation Analysis**:
   - Generate a correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical features.

 **Assess Missing Values**:
   - Evaluate the presence and extent of missing values in the dataset.

 **Detect Outliers**:
   - Implement methods to identify outliers in numerical features.
