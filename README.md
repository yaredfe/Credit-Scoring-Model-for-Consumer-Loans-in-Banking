# Credit-Scoring-Model-for-Consumer-Loans-in-Banking
This project involves building a Credit Scoring Model for consumer lending in the banking sector. The model predicts customer creditworthiness, assigns a risk score, and estimates loan default probability. It also helps optimize loan amounts and durations, providing a robust solution for managing credit risk in consumer loans.
